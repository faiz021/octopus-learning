        <h4>Low resolution of perimetric testing</h4>
        <p>It’s impractical to test every location in the visual field so perimetry has <b>low spatial resolution.</b></p>
        <p>It’s also impractical to test using each possible light intensity so <b>luminance resolution is also low.</b></p>

            <h4>Low resolution of perimetric testing</h4>
            <p>Ideally, the hill of vision would be drawn from an <b>infinite number of test locations.</b></p>
            <p>Like pixels in a digital camera sensor, the <b>greater the number of test locations</b> in a visual field test
              the
              <b>higher the special resolution.</b></p>
            <p>Practicalities mean that only <b>sampling a limited number of locations</b> is possible.</p>

          <h4>Light sensitivity</h4>
          <p>Similarly, the hill of vision would be drawn from a <b>stimulus of continuously changing luminance.</b></p>
          <p>However, <b>time constraints</b> in particular make this approach impractical, so again as with the number of stimuli
            locations,
            <b>only some luminance levels</b> are included in the test.</p>

        <h4>The effects of age and test location</h4>
        <p>It has already been established that normal sensitivity thresholds depend on the test location, with <b>sensitivity higher in the centre than in the periphery.</b></p>
        <p>Because normal <b>sensitivity to light decreases with increasing age</b> the hill of vision is also affected by age.</p>

    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <div class="container">
        <h4>The effects of age and test location</h4>
        <p>Therefore, the normal hill of vision is <b>higher in a 20 year old than in an 85 year old.</b></p>
        <p>Such patient specific factors mean that sensitivity thresholds are difficult to interpret.</p>
        <p>Normal reference values (<b>normative database</b>) are used to aid clinical visual field interpretation.</p>

        <h4>The effects of age and test location</h4>
        <p>Values for <b>each age group and test location</b> are included in a normative database.</p>
        <p>The <b>normative value</b> is compared with the <b>measured value</b> for a given age group at each location.</p>
        <p>The difference describes the <b>loss in sensitivity</b> and is referred to as the <b>deviation or defect.</b></p>

        <h4>Objectivity, subjectivity and normal fluctuations</h4>
        <p>In terms of equipment and test conditions perimetry is regarded as <b>an objective process.</b></p>
        <p>The patient does however introduce a <b>subjective element.</b></p>
        <p>As a result there are always <b>fluctuations among different normal individuals</b> and between <b>different measurements of the same individual over a short period of time.</b></p>

      <div class="container">
        <h4>Objectivity, subjectivity and normal fluctuations</h4>
        <p>The likelihood of seeing or not seeing a stimulus is <b>probabilistic.</b></p>
        <p>As the <b>luminance increases</b>, there is a gradual <b>increase from “unseen” to “seen” responses.</b></p>
        <p>The <b>frequency-of-seeing (FOS)</b> curve is used to <b>measure fluctuations objectively.</b></p>

        <h4>The frequency-of-seeing curve</h4>
        <p><b>Normal fluctuation is not distributed in a uniform way</b> across the visual field.</p>
        <p>They tend to be <b>smaller at the centre</b> of the visual field and in <b>areas of good vision</b> when compared
          to areas of poor vision.</p>
        <p>The probability of an individual perceiving a stimulus <b>changes gradually from 0% to 100%.</b></p>
        <p>So sensitivity thresholds are defined as the stimulus luminance that is perceived with a <b>probability of 50%.</b></p>

          <h4>The frequency-of-seeing curve</h4>
          <p>The <b>FOS curve</b> provides the scientific definition of a <b>light sensitivity threshold while taking fluctuation into account.</b></p>
          <p>It shows the <b>probability</b> of perceiving a certain stimulus luminance.</p>
          <p>The <b>light sensitivity threshold</b> is defined as the stimulus luminance that can be seen <b>50% of the time.</b></p>
          <p><b>Fluctuation is quantified</b> as the range of luminance at which the probability of seeing the stimulus is 0%
            to the luminance at which the probability of seeing the stimulus is 100%.</p>

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>Perimetry has low spatial and luminance resolution because it’s impractical to test every location in the visual
          field with every possible light intensity.</p>
        <p>Practicalities mean that only a limited number of sample locations and light intensities are possible.</p>
        <p>Normal sensitivity to light decreases with increasing age.</p>
        <p>A normative database is employed to aid clinical visual field interpretation.</p>
        <p>The difference between the measured sensitivity and the normative value is the deviation or defect.</p>
        <p>The frequency-of-seeing (FOS) curve is used to objectively measure fluctuations introduced by the subject.</p>
